      <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        We operate SelfPeak Digest (the "Site") as an independent health education publication. For data protection
        purposes, we are the data controller for personal information collected through this Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this policy or your data, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:hello@yourdomain.com">hello@yourdomain.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Newsletter subscription</h3>
      <p>
        When you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your <strong>email address</strong> and, optionally,
        your <strong>first name</strong>. We also record a timestamp of your consent and the IP address from
        which the subscription was submitted, for legal compliance purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        We may use privacy-friendly analytics tools (such as Plausible, Fathom, or similar) that do not use
        cookies and do not track you across websites. These tools collect aggregated, anonymized data such as
        page views, referral sources, browser type, and country-level location. This data cannot be used to
        personally identify you.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Contact correspondence</h3>
      <p>
        If you email us directly, we retain that correspondence (including your email address and message
        content) to respond to your inquiry and for our records.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Cookies and tracking</h3>
      <p>
        We do not use advertising cookies or cross-site tracking technologies. If we use analytics, they are
        cookie-free and do not target ads. Essential cookies (such as those required for basic site functionality)
        may be used and do not require consent under applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>

      <h2>5. Data processors and third parties</h2>
      <p>We may share your data with the following categories of processors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email service provider:</strong> We use a third-party email service to manage our mailing list and deliver newsletters.

      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data sharing</h2>

        share your data with advertisers. We only share data with processors as described above, and only to the
        extent necessary to operate this Site and deliver our newsletter.

      <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
      <ul>

      </p>

      <h2>9. International data transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Our service providers may process data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Where this occurs,
        we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved
        by the European Commission or reliance on the provider's certification under an adequate framework.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against
        unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include encrypted data transmission
        (HTTPS), access controls, and regular review of our data processing practices. However, no method of
        transmission over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Site is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
        If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will indicate the date of the most recent update
        at the top of this page. If changes are significant, we will notify subscribers via email. Continued use
        of the Site after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
