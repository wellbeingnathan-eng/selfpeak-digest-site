        Some of our content may discuss topics related to alcohol, substance use, or recovery. It is important

        or stopping alcohol or substance use, please do so only under the supervision of a qualified healthcare
        professional. Never attempt to self-manage withdrawal without medical guidance.

      <h2>5. Evolving research</h2>
      <p>
        We reference peer-reviewed research and published studies where possible. However, scientific
        understanding evolves continuously. What is considered best evidence today may be revised as new
        research emerges. We make every effort to keep our content current but cannot guarantee that all
